three possible translations between master and marked tree

1. master relabellings are immediately forwarded to all children
2. master relabellings are lazily applied to children, for example
    as soon as a child is read or written to;
    although this sound beautiful the problem is to maintain
    information to determine if the marked tree went out of sync;
    it's not sufficient to check the boundaries as there might
    have occured relabellings only affecting inner regions of
    the marked tree.
3. marked tree has independant ordering, and a translation is
    applied for each read or write
