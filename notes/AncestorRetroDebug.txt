ancestor: <= x, >= y, <= z

thus: we need to check the comparison result of the iso-search
- if the pre-comp is -1, we need to make the iso-mapped x (pre) one smaller
- if the post-comp is 1, we need to make the iso-mapped y (post) one larger
- if the version-comp is -1, we need to make iso-mapped z (version) one smaller
(although, we can skip the last two steps, as the false positive is already ruled out by step 1)
(there is no iso-mapping for the version)
