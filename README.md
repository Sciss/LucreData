This is a sandbox project for implementing and probing various data structures in the Scala programming language related to marked ancestor problems and spatial nearest neighbour queries.

### requirements

Builds with xsbt (sbt 0.11) against Scala 2.9.1. Depends on [LucreSTM](http://github.com/Sciss/LucreSTM). Sub projects:

* `structs-core` &ndash; Some basic stuff used by the data structure implementations. Also the geometry types.
* `mutable` &ndash; Mutable data structures
* `txn` &ndash; Transactional data structures (based on [LucreSTM](https://github.com/Sciss/LucreSTM)).
* `views-core` &ndash; Some basic stuff used by the specific views
* `mutable-views` &ndash; Some Swing based views to show the mutable data structures
* `txn-views` &ndash; Some Swing based views to show the transactional data structures


### creating an IntelliJ IDEA project

If you haven't globally installed the sbt-idea plugin yet, create the following contents in `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt`:

    resolvers += "sbt-idea-repo" at "http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/"
    
    addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "0.11.0")

Then to create the IDEA project, run the following two commands from the xsbt shell:

    > set ideaProjectName := "LucreData"
    > gen-idea
